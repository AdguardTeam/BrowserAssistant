## What can it do?

ðŸš¦ Manage filtering on the website
It's easy to whitelist a website. Switch off (or back on) ad blocking for any website right in the Assistant's main menu.

âœ‚ Block any annoying element manually
Say, youâ€™ve seen an element (whether it be a text, picture, video, banner, or else) you dislike. You can easily select and delete it.

ðŸ—‘ Delete all user rules related to a web page
While you block various elements you dislike â€” user filters are created. This functionality helps remove all changes by one click in case you want to go back to the way things were.

ðŸš¨ Report site (if an ad snuck in by accident)
Browsing, you were suddenly distracted by a sneaky ad? Report it immediately and it wonâ€™t stand a chance.

âœ… Easy access to the AdGuard desktop app
Now itâ€™s much easier to open settings or watch filtering log applicable to the web page youâ€™re on â€” you donâ€™t have to open the desktop app for these needs.
